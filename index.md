Formulog extends the logic programming language Datalog with mechanisms for constructing and reasoning about SMT formulas. In doing so, it makes it possible to write a range of SMT-based static analyses in a way that is both close to their formal specifications and amenable to high-level optimizations and efficient evaluation.
